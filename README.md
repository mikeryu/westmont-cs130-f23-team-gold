This license was chosen for this project because we as a team and as students prioritize
the sharing of knowledge for the benefit of the communities that we are a part of.
We recognize that we would not be here, learning as we are, without the selfless sharing
of knowledge by others and the prioritization of communities over individual interest.
We want this project to be in the same spirit as the gift of knowledge we have each
received, and have chosen this license accordingly.
